# Btlejack firmware

This repository contains the firmware source code used by Btlejack to communicate and attack BLE connections with Micro:Bit devices.

Two versions of this firmware can be compiled:

 * a version for the BBC Micro:Bit
 * a version for BLE400 and Adafruit's Bluefruit LE boards

To compile these two versions:

```
$ make all
```

On Python 3.7+, you may need to hack yotta to avoid pickle errors https://github.com/ARMmbed/yotta/issues/863
```
grep -r  @fsutils.dropRootPrivs /usr/local/lib/python3.8/site-packages/yotta/
```
Firmware hex files are then available in the `dist` directory (not versioned).
